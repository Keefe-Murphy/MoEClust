\title{Convert MoEClust objects to the Mclust class}
\usage{
as.Mclust(x,
          expert.covar = TRUE,
          signif = 0L,
          ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{"MoEClust"} generated by \code{\link{MoE_clust}} or an object of class \code{"MoECompare"} generated by \code{\link{MoE_compare}}. Models with a noise component are facilitated here too.}

\item{expert.covar}{Logical (defaults to \code{TRUE}) governing whether the extra variabilitity in the component means is added to the MVN ellipses corresponding to the component covariance matrices in the presence of expert network covariates. See the function \code{\link{expert_covar}}.}

\item{signif}{Significance level for outlier removal. Must be a single number in the interval [0, 1). Corresponds to the percentage of data to be considered extreme and therefore removed (half of \code{signif} at each endpoint, on a column-wise basis). The default, \code{0}, corresponds to no outlier removal. \strong{Only} invoke this argument as an aid to visualisation via \code{\link[mclust]{plot.Mclust}}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to other methods.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"Mclust"}. See \code{methods(class="Mclust")} for a (non-exhaustive) list of functions which can be applied to this class.
}
\description{
Converts an object of class \code{"MoEClust"} generated by \code{\link{MoE_clust}} and converts it to an object of class \code{"Mclust"} as generated by fitting \code{\link[mclust]{Mclust}}, to facilitate use of plotting and other functions for the \code{"Mclust"} class within the \pkg{mclust} package. Some caution is advised when converting models with gating &/or expert covariates (see Note below).
}
\details{
Of course, the user is always encouraged to use the dedicated \code{\link[=plot.MoEClust]{plot}} function for objects of the \code{"MoEClust"} class instead, but calling \code{plot} after converting via \code{\link{as.Mclust}} can be particularly useful for univariate mixtures.

In the presence of expert network covariates, the component-specific covariance matrices are (by default, via the argument \code{expert.covar}) modified for plotting purposes via the function \code{\link{expert_covar}}, in order to account for the extra variability of the means, usually resulting in bigger shapes & sizes for the MVN ellipses.

The \code{signif} argument is intended only to aid visualisation via \code{\link[mclust]{plot.Mclust}}, as plots therein can be sensitive to outliers, particularly with regard to axis limits.
}
\note{
Of the functions which can be applied to the result of the conversion, \code{\link[mclust]{logLik.Mclust}} shouldn't be trusted in the presence of either expert network covariates, or (for models with more than 1 component) gating network covariates.

Mixing proportions are averaged over observations in components in the presence of gating network covariates during the coercion.

Plots may be quite misleading in the presence of gating &/or expert covariates when the \code{what} argument is \code{"density"} within \code{\link[mclust]{plot.Mclust}}; users are \strong{strongly} encouraged to use \code{\link{MoE_gpairs}} with \code{response.type="density"} instead.

The functions \code{\link[mclust]{clustCombi}} and \code{\link[mclust]{clustCombiOptim}} can be safely used (provided \code{as.Mclust(x)} is supplied as the \code{object} argument to \code{\link[mclust]{clustCombi}}), as they only rely on \code{x$z} and \code{x$G} only. See the examples below.
