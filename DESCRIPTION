Description: Clustering via parsimonious Gaussian Mixtures of Experts using the MoEClust models introduced by Murphy and Murphy (2017) <arXiv:1711.05632>. This package fits finite Gaussian mixture models with gating and/or expert network covariates using a range of parsimonious covariance parameterisations via the EM algorithm. Visualisation of the results of such models using generalised pairs plots is also facilitated.
