Title: Finite Gaussian Mixtures of Experts: Parsimonious Model-Based Clustering with Covariates
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Keefe", "Murphy", email = "keefe.murphy@ucd.ie", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Fits finite Mixtures of Experts models with mclust family covariance structures using the EM algorithm, ie. allows incorporation of covariates into the mixing proportions and/or Gaussian densities of finite mixture models under the various covariance parameterisations in the mclust family. Also visualises mixture of experts models with parsimonious covariance parameterisations using generalised pairs plots.
