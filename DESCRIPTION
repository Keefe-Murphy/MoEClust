Description: Clustering via parsimonious Gaussian Mixtures of Experts using the MoEClust models introduced by Murphy and Murphy (2019) <doi:10.1007/s11634-019-00373-8>. This package fits finite Gaussian mixture models with a formula interface for supplying gating and/or expert network covariates using a range of parsimonious covariance parameterisations from the GPCM family via the EM/CEM algorithm. Visualisation of the results of such models using generalised pairs plots and the inclusion of an additional noise component is also facilitated. A greedy forward stepwise search algorithm is provided for identifying the optimal model in terms of the number of components, the GPCM covariance parameterisation, and the subsets of gating/expert network covariates.
